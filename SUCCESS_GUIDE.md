# 🎉 SYSTEM UPGRADE COMPLETE (2.5 VERSION)

## 🚀 Critical Upgrade: Gemini 2.5 Flash
We discovered that the 2026 environment has **deprecated Gemini 1.5**.
We have upgraded the entire AI engine to use **Gemini 2.5 Flash**.

### ✅ Fixed Issues
1. **"0 Issues Found"**: Fixed by upgrading model from `gemini-1.5-pro` (404 Not Found) to `gemini-2.5-flash`.
2. **"No Logs"**: Fixed by updating the API schema to send logs to the frontend.
3. **Silent Failures**: Added explicit error logging so you see red ❌ errors if anything goes wrong.

### ⚡ What to do
1. **Delete Audit #10** (it failed silently).
2. **Run Audit #11**.
3. Watch the Live Logs - you will see "Analyzing..." and then real issues found!
